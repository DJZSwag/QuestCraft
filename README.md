# QuestCraft
![QC](/QCSimple3.jpg)

QuestCraft, utilizing Vivecraft and Pojlib, is a standalone port of Minecraft: Java Edition to Oculus Quest Headsets. With a team of four main developers and 8 third-party developers, over the past year, we have not only gotten the bestselling game, Minecraft: Java Edition running on Android, but we have also worked with third-party developers to bring it into Virtual Reality on the Oculus Quest line of standalone HMDs.

# Features

**\*Playing on a Quest 1 may have some caveats. A list of said caveats will be provided later.**                                                                                                           
***\*Not all mods are on ModManager. If a mod you are looking for is not available, you can install it manually.** 

# Installation Instructions

**NOTE: To install QuestCraft, you must have an internet connection for the initial setup to succeed. Furthermore, you MUST own a legal, valid copy of Minecraft: Java Edition to play!**

**Ensure your Quest is on v51 or later (excl. Quest 1) before installing!**

First, go to the release page for **[QuestCraft](https://github.com/QuestCraftPlusPlus/QuestCraft/releases/latest)** and download the APK to your computer or Android device.

Secondly, you must install the QuestCraft APK to your VR Headset using **[SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com/setup-howto)** and follow the necessary steps to connect your Quest. Drag and drop the APK, and wait for it to install.

Next, open your headset's QuestCraft launcher (through Unknown Sources). Be sure to grant all requested permissions. Once you're done, you'll follow the on-screen prompts to enter your Minecraft login details, then press play and wait for all of the files to download (approx. 10 minutes).  (You must do this for each specific version to play that version!)

**NOTE: You may encounter crashes when downloading your selected MC version, ESPECIALLY on v53 and later. This is because Meta can't fix memory leaks for some reason. Don't fret; launch the app, press play, and the download will continue from where it left off before the crash. If it continues, please keep trying. If, after 4 attempts, you still are not loaded in, please visit the support channel of the QuestCraft Discord (discord.gg/questcraft)**

And boom! You have successfully installed QuestCraft on your VR headset! To play, press the **Play** button and wait for it to load; depending on the headset's age, it might take a while.

### DO NOT ENABLE SEATED MODE!

## Included Mods 

**Did you experience a mod-related crash when loading MC? It's (kinda) simple to fix it!**

## Some Recommended Settings and Tips
1. In-game, Go to Options/VR Settings/Stereo Rendering in the options menu and set the resolution (NOT CAMERA RES) to 80%. Doing this will decrease the general resolution but will give an extra performance boost.
2. The game's render distance is best at 4-8, but you *may* encounter lag spikes when using it. 9 and above is not recommended.
3. Oceans contain LOTS of kelp that decreases framerate. Don't mine any of it all at once, as your game may CRASH if many entities (in this case, kelp waiting to be picked up) exist simultaneously.
4. **[Skyblock](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tutorials/Skyblock)** and **[Oneblock](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/worlds/oneblock)** worlds perform the best, as they require less hardware usage.
