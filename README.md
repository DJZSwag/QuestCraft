# Welcome to the QuestCraft GitHub!
### **[Support us on Patreon!](https://patreon.com/QuestCraftXR)**

## QuestCraft is now in LTS!
### LTS means Long Term Support, it means the game will be updated less and less unless it is for a bug fix. We are ensuring right now that the game is bug free and performance is improved as much as possible before this happens. 
*(For more information, please read the **[Discord announcement.](https://discord.com/channels/820767484042018829/820788932123688960/1138300818064416801)**)*

         
# QuestCraft
![QC](/QCSimple3.jpg)

QuestCraft, utilizing Vivecraft and Pojlib, is a standalone port of Minecraft: Java Edition to Oculus Quest Headsets. With a team of four main developers and 8 third-party developers, over the past year, we have not only gotten Minecraft: Java Edition to run on Android, but we have also worked with third-party developers to bring it into Virtual Reality on the Meta Quest line of standalone HMDs.

# Features
- ### **Roomscale Minecraft VR!** 
- ### **Quest 2 Native!\***
- ### **Full Multiplayer!**                                                                    
- ### **Immersive Controls!**                                                                                                   
- ### **Supports 1.18.2, 1.19.2-4, and 1.20.1!**                                                                                                                              
- ### **Includes a launcher that allows you to start QuestCraft, as well as switch between versions, update installed mods and other MC components in milliseconds, and using Mod Manager, download and install supported mods right from your Quest!\****
**\*Quest 1 Support is no longer available.**


***\*Not all mods are on ModManager, if a mod you are looking for is not available, you can install it manually.** 

# Installation Instructions

**NOTE: To install QuestCraft, you must have an internet connection for the initial setup to succeed, and make sure your Quest 2 is on v51 and above. Furthermore, you MUST own a legal, valid copy of Minecraft: Java Edition to play!**

To begin, visit the release page of **[QuestCraft](https://github.com/QuestCraftPlusPlus/QuestCraft/releases/latest)** and download the APK onto your computer or Android device.

Secondly, install the QuestCraft APK to your VR Headset using **[SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com/setup-howto)** and follow the necessary steps to connect your Quest. Drag and drop the APK, and wait for it to install.

Next, open your headset's QuestCraft launcher (through Unknown Sources). Be sure to grant all requested permissions (Microphone permissions are for Simple Voice Chat!). Once you're done, you'll follow the on-screen prompts to enter your Minecraft login details, then press play and wait for all of the files to download (aproxx. 10 minutes).  (You must do this for each specific version to play that version!)

And boom! You have successfully installed QuestCraft on your VR headset! To play, press the **Play** button and wait for it to load; depending on the headset, it might take a while.

### DO NOT ENABLE SEATED MODE!

**NOTE: You may encounter crashes when downloading your selected MC version, ESPECIALLY on v53 and later. This is because of a memory leak on Meta's end. Don't fret; launch the app again, press play again, and the download will continue where it left off before the crash. If it continues, please keep trying. If, after 4 attempts, you still are not loaded in, please visit the support channel of the QuestCraft Discord (discord.gg/QuestCraft).**

## Included Mods 

**Did you experience a mod-related crash when loading MC? It's simple to fix it!**
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Join the QuestCraft Discord Server at **discord.gg/QuestCraft** and go to #bot-commands. Type /logs and upload your log file (which can be retrieved from Android/data/com.qcxr.qcxr using a file viewer e.g Windows Explorer). The QuestCraft Bot, CraftyVR, will give you ways you can fix the crash. Alternatively, you can scroll to the bottom of the retrieved log and check the Fabric error message if present. 


If you need help with crashes, please go to the support channel of the QuestCraft Discord (discord.gg/QuestCraft).

## Some Recommended Settings and Tips 
1. In the options menu, go to VR Settings/Stereo Rendering and set the resolution (NOT CAMERA RES) to 80%. This will decrease the general quality but will give an extra performance boost.
2. The game's render distance is best at 4-6, but you *may* encounter lag spikes when using it. 9 and above is not recommended.
3. Oceans contain LOTS of kelp that decreases framerate. Don't mine any of it all at once, as your game may CRASH if many entities (in this case, kelp waiting to be picked up) exist simultaneously.
4. **[Skyblock](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tutorials/Skyblock)** and **[Oneblock](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/worlds/oneblock)** worlds perform the best, as they require less hardware usage.
